# AgriLink

## Deploying to AWS EC2 (Ubuntu)

This app has a Next.js frontend and an Express + MySQL backend. The backend listens on PORT (default 5000); the frontend is served by Next.js on port 3000. Next rewrites proxy /api/* and /uploads/* to the backend.

### 1) Provision EC2
- Ubuntu 22.04 or Amazon Linux 2023
- Inbound security group: TCP 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS)

### 2) Install runtime
```
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install -y nginx mysql-client
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
sudo npm i -g pm2
```

### 3) Clone and configure
```
git clone <your-repo-url> /var/www/agrilink
cd /var/www/agrilink
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env to point to your RDS/DB and SECRET_KEY
pnpm i || npm i
```

### 4) Build Next and start services with PM2
```
npm run build
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
pm2 save
```

### 5) Nginx reverse proxy to Next.js (port 3000)
Create /etc/nginx/sites-available/agrilink and symlink to sites-enabled.

```
server {
	listen 80;
	server_name _;
	client_max_body_size 20m;

	location / {
		proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
		proxy_http_version 1.1;
		proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
		proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
		proxy_set_header Host $host;
		proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
	}
}
```

```
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/agrilink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/agrilink
sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

The backend is proxied by Next.js rewrites at /api/* and /uploads/*.

### Database
Use the schema in schema.sql to initialize your MySQL (RDS/Aurora/MySQL on EC2). Ensure your DB security group allows the EC2 instance to connect.

Migration note: If you see ER_BAD_FIELD_ERROR about farmers.user_id
- The backend maps an authenticated farmer user to their farmer profile via farmers.user_id.
- If your database was created before this column existed, run either:
	- node scripts/migrate_farmers_user_id.js (preferred), or
	- Manually apply: ALTER TABLE farmers ADD COLUMN user_id INT NULL; then backfill with UPDATE farmers f JOIN users u ON f.email=u.email SET f.user_id=u.id WHERE f.user_id IS NULL;
	- Optionally add foreign key: ALTER TABLE farmers ADD CONSTRAINT fk_farmers_user_id FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id);
This is idempotent in the provided migration script.

### Environment
See .env.example for required variables.
