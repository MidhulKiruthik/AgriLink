        Venus, the second planet from the Sun, is often referred to as Earth's twin due to its similar size and structure. However, its surface conditions are vastly different, with scorching temperatures of around 465°C (869°F) and an atmosphere dominated by carbon dioxide, creating an intense greenhouse effect.
        Venus has the longest rotation period of any planet in the solar system, taking 243 Earth days to complete one rotation. Interestingly, it rotates in the opposite direction to most other planets, causing the Sun to rise in the west and set in the east. 
        The thick atmosphere and sulfuric acid clouds make Venus a challenging target for exploration, but its study provides valuable insights into climate science and the effects of greenhouse gases. Though ISRO has not yet launched a Venus mission, its proposed Shukrayaan-1 mission highlights India’s interest in exploring this enigmatic planet.
