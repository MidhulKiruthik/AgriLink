    <!-- Description of the Solar System -->
    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
        <font color="darkslategray" size="4">
            ☄️ The Solar System is a vast and fascinating region of space dominated by the Sun, a massive star at its center. It consists of eight planets, along with dwarf planets like Pluto, and countless smaller celestial bodies, such as moons, asteroids, and comets, all bound by the Sun's gravitational pull. The planets vary greatly in size, composition, and distance from the Sun, ranging from the rocky terrestrial planets like Earth and Mars to the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn, and the icy outer worlds such as Uranus and Neptune. The Solar System also includes the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud, regions filled with icy bodies and remnants from its formation 4.6 billion years ago. Together, these components create a dynamic and ever-changing cosmic neighborhood, offering endless opportunities for exploration and discovery.
