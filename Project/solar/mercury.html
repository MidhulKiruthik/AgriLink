    <p style="text-indent: 50px;" >Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and the one closest to the Sun. It is a rocky planet with a surface marked by craters, resembling Earth’s Moon. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury has virtually no atmosphere, causing extreme temperature fluctuations—from scorching highs of about 430°C (800°F) during the day to freezing lows of -180°C (-290°F) at night.

        This planet completes its orbit around the Sun in just 88 Earth days, making it the fastest-moving planet in the solar system. However, its rotation is much slower, taking 59 Earth days to complete one spin on its axis. Mercury’s core is rich in iron, and it has a weak magnetic field. Its lack of a substantial atmosphere makes it an unlikely place to support life as we know it. Though India’s space agency, ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation), has not yet launched a dedicated mission to Mercury, its advancements in planetary exploration, such as Chandrayaan and Mangalyaan, hint at a promising future for studying planets like Mercury and beyond.</p>
