            <p style="text-align: justify;">Hello! My name is <strong>Midhul kiruthik</strong>, and I am a passionate web developer with a love for creating clean and user-friendly designs. Over the years, I have honed my skills in front-end development, making websites that not only look great but also function seamlessly.</p>
        </div>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies and keeping up with the latest trends in web development. I believe in the power of <strong>strong</strong> collaboration and teamwork, which have always helped me grow professionally and personally. When I'm not coding, I indulge in reading books and hiking in nature.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">My ultimate goal is to create meaningful projects that make a difference. I am always looking for ways to <em>improve</em> and contribute to the tech community. If you're interested in working with me or just want to connect, feel free to reach out!</p>
        <p>
            <strong style="color: blue;">Note:</strong> 
            The <strong>strong</strong> tag visually bolds text and adds semantic importance, while <b>bold</b> only affects styling. Similarly, the <em>emphasize</em> tag italicizes text and implies emphasis, while <i>italic</i> is purely stylistic.
